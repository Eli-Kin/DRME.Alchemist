                  Dalton's atomic theory set the stage for a vigorous growth in
                  chemical experimentation during the early 1800s. As the body
                  of chemical observations grew and the list of known elements
                  expanded, attempts were made to find regularities in chemical
                  behavior. These efforts culminated in the development of the
                  periodic table in 1869. We will have much to say about the
                  periodic table in later chapters, but it is so important and
                  useful that you should become acquainted with it now.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Many elements show very strong similarities to each other. For
                  example, lithium (Li), sodium (Na), and potassium (K) are all
                  soft, very reactive metals. The elements helium (He), neon
                  (Ne), and argon (Ar) are very nonreactive gases. If the
                  elements are arranged in order of increasing atomic number,
                  their chemical and physical properties are found to show a
                  repeating, or periodic, pattern.

                The arrangement of elements in order of increasing atomic
                number, with elements having similar properties placed in
                vertical columns, is known as the <b>periodic table</b>. You may
                notice slight variations in periodic tables from one book to
                another or between those in the lecture hall and in the text.
                These are simply matters of style, or they might concern the
                particular information included; there are no fundamental
                differences.

                The elements in a column of the periodic table are known as a
                group. The labeling of the groups is basically arbitrary, and
                three different labeling schemes are in common use, two of which
                are shown in Figure 2.13. The top set of labels, which have A
                and 13 designations, is widely used in North America. Roman
                numerals, rather than Arabic ones, are often employed in this
                scheme. For example, group 7A is often labeled VIIA. Europeans
                use a similar convention that numbers the columns from 1A
                through 8A and then from 1B through 8B, thereby giving the label
                7B (or VIIB) instead of 7A to the group headed by fluorine (F).
                In an effort to eliminate this confusion, the International
                Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) has proposed a new
                convention that numbers the groups from 1 through 18 with no A
                or B designations, as shown in the lower set of labels at the
                top of the table in Figure 2.13. We will use the traditional
                North American convention.

              <p>
                Elements that belong to the same group often exhibit some
                similarities in their physical and chemical properties. For
                example, the "coinage metals"—copper (Cu), silver (Ag), and gold
                (Au)—all belong to group 113. As their name suggests, the
                coinage metals are used throughout the world to make coins. Many
                other groups in the periodic table have group names. For
                example, group 1A lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium (Rb),
                cesium (Cs), and francium (Fr)—is known as the alkali metals.
                The names of several of the groups in the periodic table are
                given in Table 2.3.
              </p>

              <br />

              <p>
                We will learn in Chapters 6 and 7 that the elements in a group
                of the periodic table have similar properties because they have
                the same type of arrangement of electrons at the periphery of
                their atoms. However, we need not wait until then to make good
                use of the periodic table; after all, the table was invented by
                chemists who knew nothing about electrons! We can use the table,
                as they intended, to correlate the behaviors of elements and to
                aid in remembering many facts. You will find it helpful to refer
                to the periodic table frequently in studying the remainder of
                this chapter.
              </p>

              <br />

              <p>
                Even in our first viewing of the periodic table we can see
                patterns in the physical properties of the elements. All the
                elements on the left side and in the middle of the periodic
                table (except for hydrogen) are <b>metallic elements</b>, or
                metals. The majority of elements are metallic. Metals share many
                characteristic properties, such as luster and high electrical
                and heat conductivity. All metals, with the exception of mercury
                (Hg), are solids at room temperature. The metals are separated
                from the <b>nonmetallic elements</b> by a diagonal steplike line
                that runs from boron (B) to astatine (At), as shown in Figure
                2.13. Hydrogen, although on the left side of the periodic table,
                is a nonmetal. At room temperature some of the nonmetals are
                gaseous, some are liquid, and some are solid. They generally
                differ from the metals in appearance (Figure 2.14 4) and in
                other physical properties. Many of the elements that lie along
                the line that separates metals from nonmetals, such as antimony
                (Sb), have properties that fall between those of metals and
                nonmetals. These elements are often referred to as
                <b>metalloids</b>.
