                  Let's begin our study of chemistry by examining some
                  fundamental ways in which matter is classified and described.
                  Two of the principal ways of classifying matter are according
                  to its physical state, as a gas, liquid, or solid, and
                  according to its composition, as an element, compound, or
                  mixture.
                </p>

                  <em>Figure 1.4</em> - The three physical states of water are
                  common and familiar to us: water vapor, liquid water, and ice.
                  We cannot see water vapor. What we see when we look at steam
                  or clouds is tiny droplets of liquid water dispersed in the
                  atmosphere. In this photo we see both the liquid and solid
                  states of water. The molecular views show that the molecules
                  in the solid are arranged in a more orderly way than in the
                  liquid. The molecules in the gas are much farther apart than
                  those in the liquid or the solid.

              <p>
                A sample of matter can be a gas, a liquid, or a solid. These
                three forms of matter are called the states of matter. The
                <b>states of matter</b> differ in some of their simple
                observable properties. A <b>gas</b> (also known as vapor) has no
                fixed volume or shape; rather, it conforms to the volume and
                shape of its container. A gas can be com-pressed to occupy a
                smaller volume, or it can expand to occupy a larger one. A
                <b>liquid</b> has a distinct volume independent of its container
                but has no specific shape. It assumes the shape of the portion
                of the container that it occupies. A <b>solid</b> has both a
                definite shape and a definite volume; it is rigid. Neither
                liquids nor solids can be compressed to any appreciable extent.
              </p>

              <br />

              <p>
                The properties of the states can be understood on the molecular
                level (Figure 1.4). In a gas the molecules are far apart and are
                moving at high speeds, colliding repeatedly with each other and
                with the walls of the container. Ina liquid the molecules are
                packed more closely together, but still move rapidly; allowing
                them to slide over each other; thus, liquids pour easily. In a
                solid the molecules are held tightly together, usually in
                definite arrangements, in which the molecules can wiggle only
                slightly in their otherwise fixed positions.' Thus, solids have
                rigid shapes.
              </p>

                <em>Figure 1.5</em> - Each element contains a unique kind of
                atom. Elements might consist of individual atoms, as in (a), or
                molecules, as in (b). Compounds contain two or more different
                atoms connected, or bonded together, as in (c). A mixture
                contains the individual units of its components, shown in (d) as
                both atoms and molecules.

                Pure Substances and Mixtures
              </h1>

              <p>
                Most forms of matter that we encounter—for example, the air we
                breathe (a gas), gasoline for cars (a liquid), and the sidewalk
                on which we walk (a solid)—are not chemically pure. We can,
                however, resolve, or separate, these kinds of matter into
                different pure substances. A <b>pure substance</b> (usually
                referred to simply as a substance) is matter that has a fixed
                composition and distinct properties. For example, water and
                ordinary table salt (sodium chloride), the primary-components of
                seawater, are pure substances.
              </p>

              <br />

              <p>
                We can classify substances as either elements or compounds.
                <b>Elements</b> are substances that cannot be decomposed into
                simpler substances. Each element is composed of only one kind of
                atom [Figure 1.5(a and b) A]. <b>Compounds</b>, in contrast, are
                composed of two or more elements, and thus contain two or more
                kinds of atoms [Figure 1.5(c)].
              </p>

              <br />

              <p>
                Most of the matter we encounter consists of mixtures of
                different substances. <b>Mixtures</b> are combinations of two or
                more substances in which each substance retains its own chemical
                identity and hence its own properties [Figure 1.5(d)]. Whereas
                pure substances have fixed compositions, the compositions of
                mixtures can vary. For example, a cup of sweetened coffee can
                contain either a little sugar or a lot. The substances making up
                a mixture (such as sugar and water) are called components of the
                mixture.
              </p>

              <br />

              <p>
                Some mixtures, such as sand, rocks, and wood, do not have the
                same composition, properties, and appearance throughout the
                mixture. Such mixtures are heterogeneous [Figure 1.6(a)]
                Mixtures that are uniform throughout are homogeneous. Air is a
                homogeneous mixture of the gaseous substances nitrogen, oxygen,
                and smaller amounts of other substances. The nitrogen in air has
                all the properties that pure nitrogen does because both the pure
                substance and the mixture contain the same nitrogen molecules.
                Salt, sugar, and many other substances dissolve in water to form
                homogeneous mixtures [Figure 1.6(b)]. Homogeneous mixtures are
                also called solutions. Air is a gaseous solution; gasoline is a
                liquid solution; brass is a solid solution.
