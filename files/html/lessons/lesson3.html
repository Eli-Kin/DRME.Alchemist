Most matter is composed of molecules or ions, both of which are formed from atoms. We examine molecules here and ions in the next section.</p>

                            <p>A molecule is an assembly of two or more atoms tightly bound together.

We will discuss the forces that hold the atoms together (the chemical bonds) in Chapters 8 and 9.</p>

                        <p>Many elements are found in nature in molecular form; that is, two or more of the same type of atom are bound together. For example, the oxygen normally found in air consists of molecules that contain two oxygen atoms. We represent this molecular form of oxygen by the <b>chemical formula</b> 02 (read "oh two"). The subscript in the formula tells us that two oxygen atoms are present in each molecule. Any molecule that is made up of two atoms is said to be a diatomic molecule. Oxygen also exists in another molecular form known as ozone. Molecules of ozone consist of three oxygen atoms, so its chemical formula is 03. Even though "normal" oxygen (02) and ozone are both composed only of oxygen atoms, they exhibit very different chemical and physical properties. For exam¬ple, 02 is essential for life, but 03 is toxic; 02 is odorless, whereas 03 has a sharp, pungent smell</p>

                      <br>

                        <p>The elements that normally occur as diatomic molecules are hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and the halogens. Their locations in the periodic table are shown in Figure 2.15. When we speak of the substance hydrogen, we mean 112 unless we explicitly indicate otherwise. Likewise, when we speak of oxy¬gen, nitrogen, or any of the halogens, we are referring to 02, N2, F2, C12, Br2, or 12.</p>

                      <br>

                      <p>Compounds that are composed of molecules are called <b>molecular compounds</b> and contain more than one type of atom. For example, a molecule of water consists of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. It is therefore represented by the chemical formula H2O. Lack of a subscript on the 0 indicates one atom of 0 per water molecule. Another compound composed of these same elements (in different relative proportions) is hydrogen peroxide, H202. The properties of these two compounds are very different.</p>

                      <br>

                      <p>Several common molecules are shown in Figure 2.16. Notice how the composition of each compound is given by its chemical formula. Notice also that these substances are composed only of nonmetallic elements. Most molecular sub¬stances that we will encounter contain only nonmetals.</p>

                        <h1 class="topicTitle">Molecular and Empirical Formulas</h1>
                        <p>Chemical formulas that indicate the actual numbers and types of atoms in a molecule are called <b>molecular formulas</b>. (The formulas in Figure 2.16 are molecular formulas.) Chemical formulas that give only the relative number of atoms of each type in a molecule are called empirical formulas. The subscripts in an empirical formula are always the smallest whole-number ratios. For example, the molecular formula for hydrogen peroxide is H202; its empirical formula is HO. The molecular formula for ethylene is C2H4; its empirical formula is CH2. For many substances, the molecular formula and the empirical formula are identical, as in the case of water, H20.</p>

                        <br>

                        <p>Molecular formulas provide greater information about molecules than do empirical formulas. Whenever we know the molecular formula of a com¬pound, we can determine its empirical formula. However, the converse is not true; if we know the empirical formula of a substance, we can't determine its molecular formula unless we know more information. So why do chemists concern themselves with empirical formulas? As we will see in Chapter 3, cer¬tain common methods of analyzing substances lead to the empirical formula only. Once the empirical formula is known, however, additional experiments can give the information needed to convert the empirical formula to the molecular one. In addition, there are substances such as elemental carbon that don't exist as isolated molecules. For these substances we must rely on empirical formulas. Thus, carbon is represented by its chemical symbol, C, which is its empirical formula.</p>

                      <h1 class="topicTitle">Picturing Molecules</h1>
                      <p>The molecular formula of a substance summarizes its composition but does not show how the atoms come together to form the molecule. The structural formula of a substance shows which atoms are attached to which within the molecule.</p>

                      <br>

                      <p>The atoms are represented by their chemical symbols, and lines are used to represent the bonds that hold the atoms together. Usually a structural formula does not depict the actual geometry of the molecule, that is, the actual angles at which atoms are joined together. A structural formula can be written, however, as a perspective drawing to give some sense of three-dimensional shape.</p>

                      <br>

                      <p>Scientists also rely on various models to help them visualize molecules. <b>Ball-and-stick models</b> show atoms as spheres and the bonds as sticks, and they give a good sense of the angles at which the atoms are attached to one another within the molecule. Often all atoms are represented by balls of the same size. In other cases, however, the relative sizes of the balls reflect the relative sizes of the atoms. Sometimes the chemical symbols of the elements are superimposed on the balls, but often the atoms are identified simply by color.</p>

                      <br>

                      <p>A <b>Space-Filling model</b> is a depiction of what the molecule would look like if it were scaled up in size. These models show the relative sizes of the atoms, but the angles between atoms, which help define their molecular geometry, are often more difficult to see than in ball-and-stick models. As in ball-and¬stick models, the identities of the atoms are indicated by their colors, but they may also be labeled with the element's symbol.</p>
