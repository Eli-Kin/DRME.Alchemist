                  We have seen that the atom is the smallest representative
                  sample of an element. However, only the noble gas elements are
                  normally found in nature as isolated atoms. Most matter is
                  composed of molecules or ions, both of which are formed from
                  atoms. We examine molecules here and ions in the next section.

                  A molecule is an assembly of two or more atoms tightly bound
                  together. The resultant "package" of atoms behaves in many
                  ways as a single, distinct object, just as a television set
                  composed of many parts can be recognized as a single object.
                  We will discuss the forces that hold the atoms together (the
                  chemical bonds) in Chapters 8 and 9.

                Molecules and Chemical Formulas
              </h1>

              <p>
                Many elements are found in nature in molecular form; that is,
                two or more of the same type of atom are bound together. For
                example, the oxygen normally found in air consists of molecules
                that contain two oxygen atoms. We represent this molecular form
                of oxygen by the <b>chemical formula</b> 02 (read "oh two"). The
                subscript in the formula tells us that two oxygen atoms are
                present in each molecule. Any molecule that is made up of two
                atoms is said to be a diatomic molecule. Oxygen also exists in
                another molecular form known as ozone. Molecules of ozone
                consist of three oxygen atoms, so its chemical formula is 03.
                Even though "normal" oxygen (02) and ozone are both composed
                only of oxygen atoms, they exhibit very different chemical and
                physical properties. For exam¬ple, 02 is essential for life, but
                03 is toxic; 02 is odorless, whereas 03 has a sharp, pungent
                smell
              </p>

              <br />

              <p>
                The elements that normally occur as diatomic molecules are
                hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and the halogens. Their locations in
                the periodic table are shown in Figure 2.15. When we speak of
                the substance hydrogen, we mean 112 unless we explicitly
                indicate otherwise. Likewise, when we speak of oxy¬gen,
                nitrogen, or any of the halogens, we are referring to 02, N2,
                F2, C12, Br2, or 12.

              <p>
                Compounds that are composed of molecules are called
                <b>molecular compounds</b> and contain more than one type of
                atom. For example, a molecule of water consists of two hydrogen
                atoms and one oxygen atom. It is therefore represented by the
                chemical formula H2O. Lack of a subscript on the 0 indicates one
                atom of 0 per water molecule. Another compound composed of these
                same elements (in different relative proportions) is hydrogen
                peroxide, H202. The properties of these two compounds are very
                different.
              </p>

              <br />

              <p>
                Several common molecules are shown in Figure 2.16. Notice how
                the composition of each compound is given by its chemical
                formula. Notice also that these substances are composed only of
                nonmetallic elements. Most molecular sub¬stances that we will
                encounter contain only nonmetals.

                  Molecular and Empirical Formulas
                </h1>
                <p>
                  Chemical formulas that indicate the actual numbers and types
                  of atoms in a molecule are called <b>molecular formulas</b>.
                  (The formulas in Figure 2.16 are molecular formulas.) Chemical
                  formulas that give only the relative number of atoms of each
                  type in a molecule are called empirical formulas. The
                  subscripts in an empirical formula are always the smallest
                  whole-number ratios. For example, the molecular formula for
                  hydrogen peroxide is H202; its empirical formula is HO. The
                  molecular formula for ethylene is C2H4; its empirical formula
                  is CH2. For many substances, the molecular formula and the
                  empirical formula are identical, as in the case of water, H20.
                </p>

                <br />

                <p>
                  Molecular formulas provide greater information about molecules
                  than do empirical formulas. Whenever we know the molecular
                  formula of a com¬pound, we can determine its empirical
                  formula. However, the converse is not true; if we know the
                  empirical formula of a substance, we can't determine its
                  molecular formula unless we know more information. So why do
                  chemists concern themselves with empirical formulas? As we
                  will see in Chapter 3, cer¬tain common methods of analyzing
                  substances lead to the empirical formula only. Once the
                  empirical formula is known, however, additional experiments
                  can give the information needed to convert the empirical
                  formula to the molecular one. In addition, there are
                  substances such as elemental carbon that don't exist as
                  isolated molecules. For these substances we must rely on
                  empirical formulas. Thus, carbon is represented by its
                  chemical symbol, C, which is its empirical formula.

              <h1 ls3t3 class="topicTitle">Picturing Molecules</h1>
              <p>
                The molecular formula of a substance summarizes its composition
                but does not show how the atoms come together to form the
                molecule. The structural formula of a substance shows which
                atoms are attached to which within the molecule.
              </p>

              <br />

              <p>
                The atoms are represented by their chemical symbols, and lines
                are used to represent the bonds that hold the atoms together.
                Usually a structural formula does not depict the actual geometry
                of the molecule, that is, the actual angles at which atoms are
                joined together. A structural formula can be written, however,
                as a perspective drawing to give some sense of three-dimensional
                shape.
              </p>

              <br />

              <p>
                Scientists also rely on various models to help them visualize
                molecules. <b>Ball-and-stick models</b> show atoms as spheres
                and the bonds as sticks, and they give a good sense of the
                angles at which the atoms are attached to one another within the
                molecule. Often all atoms are represented by balls of the same
                size. In other cases, however, the relative sizes of the balls
                reflect the relative sizes of the atoms. Sometimes the chemical
                symbols of the elements are superimposed on the balls, but often
                the atoms are identified simply by color.
              </p>

              <br />

              <p>
                A <b>Space-Filling model</b> is a depiction of what the molecule
                would look like if it were scaled up in size. These models show
                the relative sizes of the atoms, but the angles between atoms,
                which help define their molecular geometry, are often more
                difficult to see than in ball-and-stick models. As in
                ball-and¬stick models, the identities of the atoms are indicated
                by their colors, but they may also be labeled with the element's
                symbol.
