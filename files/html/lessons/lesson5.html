                  Every substance has a unique set of properties,
                  characteristics that allow us to recognize it and to
                  distinguish it from other substances. For example, the
                  properties of hydrogen, oxygen, and water allow us to
                  distinguish these substances from one another. The properties
                  of matter can be grouped into two categories: physical and
                  chemical. We can measure physical properties without changing
                  the identity and composition of the substance. These
                  properties include color, odor, density, melting point,
                  boiling point, and hardness. Chemical properties describe the
                  way a substance may change or react to form other substances.
                  For example, a common chemical property is flammability, the
                  ability of a substance to burn in the presence of oxygen. Some
                  properties such as temperature, melting point, and density do
                  not depend on the amount of the sample being examined.

                These properties, called intensive properties, are particularly
                useful in chemistry because many can be used to identify
                substances. Extensive properties of substances depend on the
                quantity of the sample and include measurements of mass and
                volume. Extensive properties relate to the amount of substance
                present.

                Physical and Chemical Changes
              </h1>

              <p>
                As with the properties of a substance, the changes that
                substances undergo can be classified as either physical or
                chemical. During physical changes a substance changes its
                physical appearance but not its composition. The evaporation of
                water is a physical change. When water evaporates, it changes
                from the liquid state to the gas state, but its composition does
                not change; it is still water. All changes of state (for
                example, from liquid to gas or from liquid to solid) are
                physical changes.
              </p>

              <br />

              <p>
                <em>Figure 1.13</em> - In chemical reactions the chemical
                identities of substances change. Here, a mixture of hydrogen and
                oxygen undergoes chemical change to form water.
              </p>

              <br />

              <p>
                In chemical changes (also called chemical reactions) a substance
                is trans-formed into a chemically different substance. For
                example, when hydrogen burns in air, it undergoes a chemical
                change in which it is converted to water. The molecular-level
                view of this process is depicted in Figure 1.13 .

                <em>Figure 1.14</em> - The chemical reaction between a copper
                penny and nitric acid. The dissolved copper produces the
                blue-green solution; the reddish brown gas produced is nitrogen
                dioxide.

              <p>
                Chemical changes can be dramatic. The following account
                describes a young man's first experiences with chemical
                reactions. The writer is Ira Remsen, author of a popular
                chemistry text published in 1901. The chemical reaction that he
                observed is,shown in Figure 1.14.

              <br />

              <p>
                While reading a textbook of chemistry, I came upon the statement
                "nitric acid acts upon copper," and I determined to see what
                this meant. Having located some nitric acid, I had only to learn
                what the words "act upon" meant. In the interest of knowledge I
                was even willing to sacrifice one of the few copper cents then
                in my possession. I put one of them on the table, opened a
                bottle labeled "nitric acid," poured some of the liquid on the
                copper, and prepared to make an observation. But what was this
                wonderful thing which I beheld? The cent was already changed,
                and it was no small change either. A greenish-blue liquid foamed
                and fumed over the cent and over the table. The air became
                colored dark red. How could I stop this? I tried by picking the
                cent up and throwing it out the window. I learned another fact
                nitric acid acts upon fingers. The pain led to another
                unpremeditated experiment. I drew my fingers across my trousers
                and discovered nitric acid acts upon trousers. That was the most
                impressive experiment I have ever performed. I tell of it even
                now with interest. It was a revelation to me. Plainly the only
                way to learn about such remarkable kinds of action is to see the
                results, to experiment, to work in the laboratory.

              <p>
                Many properties of matter are quantitative; that is, they are
                associated with numÂ¬bers. When a number represents a measured
                quantity, the units of that quantity must always be specified.
                To say that the length of a pencil is 17.5 is meaningless. To
                say that it is 17.5 centimeters (cm) properly specifies the
                length. The units used for scientific measurements are those of
                the metric system.

                A Closer Look - The Scientific Method
              </h1>

              <p>
                Chemistry is an experimental science. The idea of using
                experiments to understand nature seems like such a natural
                pattern of thought to us now, but there was a time, before the
                seventeenth century, when experiments were rarely used. The
                ancient Greeks, for example, did not rely on experiments to test
                their ideas.
              </p>

              <br />

              <p>
                Although two different scientists rarely approach the same
                problem in exactly the same way, there are guide- lines for the
                practice of science that have come to be known as the scientific
                method. These guidelines are outlined in Figure 1.15. We begin
                by collecting information, or data, by observation and
                experiment. However, the collection of information is not the
                ultimate goal. The goal is to find a pattern or sense of order
                in our observations and to understand the origin of this order.
              </p>

              <br />

              <p>
                As we perform our experiments, we may begin to see patterns that
                lead us to a tentative explanation or hypothesis that guides us
                in planning further experiments. Eventually, we may be able to
                tie together a great number of observations in terms of a single
                statement or equation called a scientific law. A scientific law
                is a concise verbal statement or a mathematical equation that
                summarizes a broad variety of observations and experiences. We
                tend to think of the laws of nature as the basic rules under
                which nature operates. However, it is not so much that matter
                obeys the laws of nature, but rather that the laws of nature
                describe the behavior of matter.
              </p>

              <br />

              <p>
                At many stages of our studies we may propose explanations of why
                nature behaves in a particular way. If a hypothesis is
                sufficiently general and is continually effective in predicting
                facts yet to be observed, it is called a theory or model. A
                theory is an explanation of the general principles of certain
                phenomena with considerable evidence or facts to support it.
              </p>

              <br />

              <p>
                As we proceed through this text, we will rarely have the
                opportunity to discuss the doubts, conflicts, clashes of
                personalities, and revolutions of perception that have led to
                our present ideas. We need to be aware that just because we can
                spell out the results of science so concisely and neatly in
                textbooks does not mean that scientific progress is smooth,
                certain, and predictable. Some of the ideas we have presented in
                this text took centuries to develop and involved large numbers
                of scientists. We gain our view of the natural world by standing
                on the shoulders of the scientists who came before us. Take
                advantage of this view. As you study, exercise your imagination.
                Don't be afraid to ask daring questions when they occur to you.
                You may be fascinated by what you discover!

              <p>
                <em>Figure 1.15</em> - The scientific method is a general
                approach to problems that involves making observations, seeking
                patterns in the observations, formulating hypotheses to explain
                the observations, and testing these hypotheses by further
                experiments. Those hypotheses that withstand such tests and
                prove themselves useful in explaining and predicting behavior
                become known as theories.
