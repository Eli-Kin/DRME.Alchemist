                  Since the time of <b>Rutherford</b>, physicists have learned much
                  about the detailed composition of atomic nuclei. In the course
                  of these discoveries, the list of par-tides that make up
                  nuclei has grown long and continues to increase. As chemists,
                  we can take a very simple view of the atom because only three
                  subatomic particles—the <b>proton</b>, <b>neutron</b>, and <b>electron</b> have a
                  bearing on chemical behavior.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The charge of an electron is –1.602 × 10<sup>-19</sup>C, and
                  that of a proton is + 1.602 × 10<sup>-19</sup>C. The quantity
                  1.602 × 10<sup>-19</sup>C is called the electronic charge.
                  For convenience, the charges of atomic and subatomic particles
                  are usually expressed as multiples of this charge rather than
                  in coulombs. Thus, the charge of the electron is 1–, and that
                  of the proton is 1+.

              <p>A <em>Figure 2.10</em> - Rutherford's model explaining the scattering of a particles. The gold foil is several thousand atoms thick. When an a particle collides with (or passes very close to) a gold nucleus, it is strongly repelled. The less massive is particle is deflected from its path by this repulsive interaction.

              <p>
                <b>Neutrons</b> are uncharged; that is, they are electrically neutral
                (which is how they received their name). Because atoms have an
                equal number of electrons and protons, they have no net
                electrical charge. Protons and neutrons reside together in the
                nucleus of the atom, which, as Rutherford proposed, is extremely
                small. The vast majority of an atom's volume is the space in
                which the electrons reside. The electrons are attracted to the
                protons in the nucleus by the force that exists between
                particles of opposite electrical charge. In later chapters we
                will see that the strength of the attractive forces between
                electrons and nuclei can be used to explain many of the
                differences between different elements.
              </p>

              <br />

              <p>
                <b>Atoms</b> have extremely small masses. For example, the mass of the
                heaviest known atom is on the order of 4 × 10<sup>-22</sup>g.
                Because it would he cumbersome to continually have to express such small masses in grams, we instead, use a unit called the atomic mass unit, or amu.* An amu equals 1.66054 × 10<sup>-24</sup>g. A pro¬ton has a mass of 1.0073 amu, a neutron 1.0087 amu, and an electron 5.486 × 10<sup>-4</sup>amu. The masses of the proton and neutron are very nearly equal, and both are much greater than that of an electron. In fact, it would take 1836 electrons to equal the mass of 1 proton. Thus, the nucleus contains most of the mass of an atom.
              </p>

              <br />

              <p>
                Atoms are extremely small; most have diameters between 1 × 10<sup>-10</sup>m and 5 × 10<sup>-10</sup>m, or 100-500 pm. A convenient, although non-SI, unit of length used to express atomic dimensions is the angstrom(Å). One angstrom equals 10<sup>-10</sup>m. Thus, atoms have diameters on the order of 1-5 Å. For example, the diameter of a chlorine atom is 200 pm, or 2.0 Å. Both picometers and angstroms are commonly used to express the dimensions of atoms and molecules.
              </p>

              <br>

              <p><em>Figure 2.11</em> - Schematic cross-sectional view through the center of an atom. The nucleus, which contains
                protons and neutrons, is the location of virtually all the mass of the atom. The rest of the atom is the space in which the light, negatively charged
                electrons reside.
                </p>

                <br>

                <p>The diameters of atomic nuclei are on the order of 10<sup>-4</sup>Å, only a small fraction of the diameter of the atom as a whole. You can appreciate the relative sizes of the atom and its nucleus by imagining that if the atom was as large as a foot¬ball stadium, the nucleus would be the size of a small marble. Because the tiny nucleus carries most of the mass of the atom in such a small volume, it has an in-credible density—on the order of 10<sup>13</sup>-10<sup>14</sup> g/cm<sup>3</sup>. A matchbox full of material of such density would weigh over 2.5 billion tons! Astrophysicists have suggested that the interior of a collapsed star may reach nearly this density.</p>

                <br>

                <p>An illustration of the atom that incorporates the features we have just discussed is shown in Figure 2.11. The electrons, which take up most of the volume of the atom, play the major role in chemical reactions. The significance of representing the region containing the electrons as an indistinct cloud will be-come clear in later chapters when we consider the energies and spatial arrangements of the electrons.</p>

                <h1 id="ls2t1" class="topicTitle">Isotopes, Atomic Numbers, and Mass Numbers</h1>

                <p>What makes an atom of one element different from an atom of another element? The answer to this question centers on the number of protons in the nucleus of the atom: <i>All atoms of an element have the same number of protons in the nucleus</i>. The specific number of protons is different for different elements. Furthermore, be¬cause an atom has no net electrical charge, the number of electrons in it must equal its number of protons. For example, all atoms of the element carbon have six protons and six electrons. Most carbon atoms also have six neutrons, although some have more and some have less.</p>

                <br>

                <p>Atoms of a given element that differ in the number of neutrons, and consequently in mass, are called isotopes. The symbol <sup>12</sup>C (read "carbon twelve," carbon-12) represents the carbon atom with six protons and six neutrons. The number of protons, which is called the atomic number, is shown by the subscript. The atomic number of each element is listed with the name and symbol of the element on the front inside cover of the text. Because all atoms of a given element have the same atomic number, the subscript is redundant and hence is often omitted. The superscript is called the mass number; it is the total number of protons plus neutrons in the atom. For example, some carbon atoms contain six protons and eight neutrons and are consequently represented as 14C (read "carbon fourteen"). </p>

                <br>

                <p>We will generally use the notation with subscripts and superscripts only when making reference to a particular isotope of an element. An atom of a specific isotope is called a nuclide. </p>

                <br>

                <p>
                  All atoms are made up of protons, neutrons, and electrons. Because these particles are the same in all atoms, the difference between atoms of distinct elements (gold and oxygen, for example) is due entirely to the difference in the number of subatomic particles in each atom. We can therefore consider an atom to be the smallest sample of an element because breaking an atom into subatomic particles destroys its identity.
